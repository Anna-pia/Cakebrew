# Cakebrew

The Homebrew GUI App for OS X

## About

Cakebrew does for [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) what Synaptics does to Linux package managers. With Cakebrew you can search, install, uninstall and update formulas and the Homebrew repository, all from within the app.

Do you need to use Homebrew but you are afraid to use the terminal? Cakebrew is the app for you!
